Today I've released [Tiled 0.18.1](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled), a recommended upgrade since it fixes some crashes and several other issues. It also makes a host of improvements to the GameMaker 1.4 export.

Thanks to everybody who contributed to this release with bug reports, suggestions or patches!

**A note for Windows users upgrading from previous versions using the installer:** Please first _uninstall_ Tiled manually and then reinstall using the installer. Due to fixing the installer to work properly system-wide, it will fail to upgrade versions before 0.18.1 and leave behind a broken Tiled.
