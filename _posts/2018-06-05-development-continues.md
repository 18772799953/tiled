title: Development Continues With Your Help
author: Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer

I don't like spending time on raising funds, but last month I realized I
had to either spend less time on Tiled or do a very visible call for
help. I chose to try running [a short fundraiser][1], and the result as
been absolutely amazing! Not only am I very glad that I can continue
working on Tiled for two days per week, but we have also found nearly 40
new people willing support Tiled development on a monthly basis!

I was also blown away by all the existing supporters who increased their
pledges. About 20 patrons have together increased their support by
almost $400/month. Their generosity is incredibly motivating and I will
do my best not to disappoint!

Unfortunately, it did become clear that funding my office is currently
too much of a stretch. I canceled the rental agreement, but since it has
a three-month notice I'll still have the office until the end of August.
It could be that I won't need it as much by then, since my son will go
to kindergarten and we may move to a bigger place to accommodate my
growing family. But for the next three months it remains one of my
funding goals!

### Growing Family

My wife and I are expecting our third child this month, and it could
come any day now. After that the time I spend on Tiled could become
quite a bit more spread out over the week, as opposed to the two full
days I currently work on Tiled. I am taking two months of parental leave
so that I have time to help out at home, but I do not plan to work less
on Tiled.

### Tiled 1.2

This month, I will do my best to finish Tiled 1.2. Those keeping an eye
on development already know it will bring [polygon editing
improvements][2], [multi-layer editing][3] and support for [viewing
multiple maps at once][4] among many other enhancements. Your feedback,
especially on those new features, is crucial in making Tiled 1.2 a great
upgrade, so please give the frequently updated development snapshots a
try!

Thanks again for your amazing support!
