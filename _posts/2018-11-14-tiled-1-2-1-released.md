### Current Development

I recently took [a one-month break][break] from Tiled development to
focus on renovating a house we'd like to move into soon. While that's
far from done, in the meantime I'm [back on Tiled development][back].
I've started looking into making Tiled scriptable, one of the major
features on [the roadmap][roadmap] for the next Tiled release.
