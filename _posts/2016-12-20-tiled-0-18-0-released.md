Before merging the major changes scheduled for Tiled 1.0, it was time to release [Tiled 0.18](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled), bringing a host of small enhancements!

## New Convenience Actions

Actions were added to create a new layer based on the current selection, either through copying or moving (_Layer > New > Layer via Cut/Copy_). In addition, the _Paste in Place_ action now works for tile layers, pasting a section of tiles at exactly the same spot as it was copied from.

A new context menu for custom properties includes actions to change the type of the custom property to another, compatible type.

A context menu action was added to reset the size of tile objects. Useful when you scaled them by accident, or when you want to adjust them after the size of the tile image changed.

Also convenient should be that the mouse wheel can now also scroll past the map boundaries and the added _Snap to Pixels_ mode.

## Reordering of Objects

While it was already possible to manually change the drawing order of objects for a long time (by setting the _Drawing Order_ of their object layer to _Manual_ and using the object context menu), now there are also buttons for this in the Objects view, regardless of the _Drawing Order_ setting.

The display order of the objects in the Objects view is now reversed, to match the ordering of the layers. This especially makes sense when using manual drawing order, because now the top-most (last drawn) object will be at the top of the list.

The new [Sticker Knight example](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/tree/master/examples/sticker-knight) demonstrates how Tiled can be used to build levels without using any tile layer.

## GameMaker: Studio export plugin

It is now possible to export maps to [GameMaker: Studio 1.4](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/features), with support for both tile and object layers (objects get translated to instances).

## Map Thumbnails on Linux

The `tmxrasterizer` tool shipping with Tiled was improved a bit and is now set up as a thumbnailer for TMX files. When Tiled is installed through the system's package management, this enables thumbnails in supporting file managers like GNOME's Nautilus and PCManFM.

## A Look Ahead

In the meantime, a major change has been made to Tiled on the `master` branch to allow external tileset files to be opened and edited alongside map files. This was the biggest task remaining for Tiled 1.0. You can already try out the new Tiled with rearranged interface by installing a development snapshot. I can use all the feedback you have to make sure Tiled 1.0 will be a great release!

We can enjoy this new release and look forward to Tiled 1.0 thanks to [170 patrons supporting me on a monthly basis](https://www.patreon.com/bjorn) as well as many people choosing to [pay for Tiled on itch.io](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled/purchase). I'm close to reaching my funding goal for spending _two full days_ per week on Tiled, but I still need your help to get there!
