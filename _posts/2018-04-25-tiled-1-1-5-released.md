The bugfixing continues in this release, to keep Tiled 1.1 from misbehaving as I try to make progress on the eventual release of Tiled 1.2. Unfortunately, one of the fixes was a regression introduced in [Tiled 1.1.4][1]. Sorry about that!

### Changelog

* Fixed erasing mode of the Terrain Brush (broken in 1.1.4)
* Fixed crash after editing a template
* Fixed rendering of eye/lock icons in Layers view (now for all platforms)

* Fixed shortcuts for flipping and rotating objects ([#1926](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1926))
* Fixed dynamic retranslation of tools and tool actions
* Fixed possible crash when undoing/redoing Wang color changes

* Remove tile collision layer along with the last object ([#1230](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1230))
