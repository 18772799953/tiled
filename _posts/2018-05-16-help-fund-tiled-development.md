title: Help to Reach My Funding Goal by End of May
author: Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer
---

I started working two days/week on Tiled [in July 2016][4], which
enabled reaching the huge [Tiled 1.0][5] milestone one year ago. Then,
after [mentoring three awesome students][6] in the GSoC 2017 and
polishing up their work, we made another big release with [Tiled
1.1][7]. Each release was followed up by [many patch releases][10]. Now,
I'm working on finishing Tiled 1.2, which will bring several great
productivity improvements and I'm already eager to continue [the
Roadmap][8] to Tiled 1.3.

### Funding Challenges

Unfortunately, in the past two months, the support on Patreon has
dropped significantly. This is mainly because 3 major patrons have
reduced their pledges, for different reasons. It is fully understandable
and even expected that this will happen sometimes, but it means
currently I'm my own biggest sponsor filling an $800/month gap, which I
can't sustain for another month. Another reason this gap became so big
is that in the past year the Dollar value has decreased by about 10%
relative to the Euro, to which I have recently adjusted my funding
goals. All this comes on top of the fact that I've already been my own
biggest sponsor for a while, funding a missing $4000 in total in 2017.

Of course, that's compared to just working full time on the job that I
have, and I accepted it because I got to do what I love! But it is not
sustainable for me and my family. If I don't reach those funding goals
by the end of the month, I'll need to cancel my office and reduce the
time I work on Tiled to one day/week. That would make me very sad and it
would greatly delay further Tiled development.

### How You Can Help

* If Tiled helps you in your project, please consider [becoming a
  patron][11]! At the current average pledge of around $5/month I could
  reach my goal when just 150 Tiled users would sign up.

* If you are working at a game development studio, please ask whether it
  would be possible for your studio to sponsor Tiled development. For
  [$100/month][12] you will even get a banner link to your studio or
  project on the Tiled website!

* Tell your friends! Share this call for help in order to have it reach
  as many people as possible. Tell them why you believe it's worth
  supporting this free and independent content development tool.

* If you don't mind being completely anonymous (could be a good thing!),
  please support [Tiled on Liberapay][9] instead. See the statement on
  that page about the advantages. I'll lower the goal on Patreon
  depending on the support on Liberapay.

### Thank you!

Last but not least, I can't thank enough all the people who have funded
Tiled development so far, both [on Patreon][13] and [on itch.io][3].
Before dropping to the current level, the monthly support had slowly
gone up to $1700/month, [reaching my two days/week goal][1] and
eventually allowing me to [rent an office again][2] so I can work more
effectively (not being surrounded by my two kids, soon to be three!).
All of you are the sole reason Tiled has kept getting better, so a big
thank-you to everybody who has contributed!
