title: Tiled 1.0 released

At long last I'm proud to announce the release of
[Tiled 1.0](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled). This release is based on a branch of
development that started 1.5 years ago, with the goal of better supporting the
use of external tileset files alongside map files. In addition I wanted to
resolve all the loose ends that made Tiled feel incomplete. Last but not least,
a huge amount of other welcome improvements were made by a record number of
contributors!

Here are some of the major new features in this release:

### Working with External Tilesets

This is a change that will likely affect your workflow, unless you stick to
using embedded tilesets (which are still supported). With the large amount of
meta-information stored in a tileset, external tilesets are a great way to share
this information across maps. Until now, these files could not be properly
edited in Tiled.

Now you can open and save tileset files independently of map files and they can
be modified the same way that embedded tilesets can. In addition, all open
external tilesets are now visible in the Tilesets view, and they will be added
to your map automatically when you start using them.

Visible changes include the tab bar being now on top of the tool bar, since
different tool bar actions and views are used when editing a tileset as opposed
to when editing a map. Also, in the tileset editor you'll now find that the
terrain information editor and tile collision editor are integrated as dockable
views.

### Layer Hierarchy

For those of you working with a large amount of map layers, there is now the
option to organize layers in a [hierarchy of groups](https://doc.mapeditor.org/manual/layers/#group-layers).
Properties like the opacity and visibility will apply recursively to all layers
in a group.

In addition, layers can now be reordered by using drag-n-drop.

### Typed Tiles and Tile Property Inheritance

Using tile objects to place entities on the map is a common use-case. Now, you
can also [associate a type with your tiles](https://doc.mapeditor.org/manual/custom-properties/#typed-tiles),
so that predefined custom properties are visible when selecting the tile or a tile object.
Basic custom properties added to a tile are also
[inherited by tile objects](https://doc.mapeditor.org/manual/custom-properties/#tile-property-inheritance).
These features can be a huge time-safer since you often no longer need to manually
fill in the object type or manually add the custom properties for each instance.

Also, cut/copy/paste actions for custom properties have been implemented.

### Text Objects

You can now [insert text objects](https://doc.mapeditor.org/manual/objects/#insert-text)
in your maps, either for visual or for annotation purposes. For each text
object, you can control its font, color, alignment and word wrapping properties.

</a>

Apart from this new object type, other improvements have been made to handling
objects, including an improved selection rectangle, the ability to
[select objects below other objects](https://doc.mapeditor.org/manual/objects/#selecting-and-deselecting)
and synchronizing the current layer to the currently selected object.

### Fixes for Hexagonal Maps

The support for hexagonal and staggered maps has greatly improved. The fill tool
now works properly for these maps, the stamp brush no longer acts weird due to
the staggering and finally hexagonal rotation (in 60-degree increments) was
added.

Thanks to everybody who contributed to this release with bug reports, suggestions or patches!

## A Look Ahead

With Tiled 1.0 out, I aim to focus a bit of time on completing the
[User Manual](https://doc.mapeditor.org) and also documenting the level of Tiled
map support by the various
[libraries and frameworks](https://doc.mapeditor.org/reference/support-for-tmx-maps/)
listed there.

Of course, feature development will continue as usual as well! On May 30th
[our Google Summer of Code students]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-05-announcing-our-google-summer-of-code-students %})
will officially start with their projects, which will likely form the basis
for Tiled 1.1.

## Support Tiled Development

Getting to this major release was only possible thanks to
[over 190 patrons](https://www.patreon.com/bjorn) supporting me on a monthly
basis as well as many people choosing to pay for
[Tiled on itch.io](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled). As of this writing I still
need more support to reach my two-days-per-week funding goal.
[Please chip in](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=90066) if
you can to ensure Tiled keeps getting better! <img src="/img/heart.png" style="width: 1em;" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:">
