Tiled is participating in [Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/)
this year as part of the [MovingBlocks](https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/movingblocks/)
organization. Google Code-In is a program aimed at getting younger
students involved in open source projects, by having them complete tasks
set up by these projects. It runs from 28th of November to 17th of
January.

Are you a pre-university student aged 13 to 17? Here's your chance
to do something fun with Tiled while at the same time contributing to
its documentation about 3rd party integrations and competing for prizes
from T-shirts to a trip to Google HQ!

At MovingBlocks they have set up
[plenty of tasks](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/?sp-organization=5693523175145472)
related to the open-source sandbox game [Terasology](http://terasology.org/).
The [Tiled tasks](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/?sp-organization=5693523175145472&sp-search=tiled)
are about improving the documentation about
the Tiled support in various
[libraries and frameworks](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/support-for-tmx-maps/),
by reading up on them and trying them out and eventually even contributing to them
directly.

## We're here to help!

The following mentors are committed to help you while working on the
Tiled tasks:

* Thorbjørn Lindeijer (**bjorn**), main developer of Tiled
* Erik Schilling (**Ablu**), Tiled contributor and GSoC mentor
* Ketan Gupta (**ketanhwr**), Tiled contributor and GSoC student

You can find us in the IRC channel, #tiled on chat.freenode.net
(accessible in the browser
[through riot.im](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#tiled:matrix.org)).
If we're not there (since we do work and sleep as well), post your question
on [the community forum](https://discourse.mapeditor.org/) and we'll answer
as soon as possible.

Have fun!
